# Hi, I'm Shruti Chougule 👋

🎯 Embedded Software Developer | Building from Bits to Systems  
📍 Bengaluru, India | 🌐 (https://www.linkedin.com/in/chouguleshruti/)

---

I'm an Embedded Software Engineer passionate about designing, building, and testing smart connected devices — from **low-level firmware** to **consumer-ready BLE remotes**.

🔧 I currently work at **Universal Electronics** where I develop production-grade firmware for BLE/IR/Zigbee-based smart remotes used by global telecom clients. I began as a test intern analyzing Bluetooth traffic, logging bugs, and validating OTA + pairing flows, and now contribute end-to-end as a developer.

Outside of work, I’m curating a learning environment where I explore and share my embedded journey — from real-world microcontroller projects and hardware debugging to RTOS architecture, protocol design, and smart device behavior — across GitHub and beyond.
